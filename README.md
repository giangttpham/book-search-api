# Book Search API

### Overview
This is a python app built using FastAPI. Currently, there's only one Rest API call. This GET call contains this logic:
- Accepts GET params from caller: `keywords`, `skip` and `limit`.
- Calls Google Books API using the `keywords` to search for books and returns the result
- `skip` and `limit` are used for pagination in the UI

### Run locally
Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` from the root directory of this repo. The server will be running on `localhost:8000`.

### Run tests
Run `pytest -v` from the root folder.

### PyCharm
This project can be loaded into PyCharm. Create a FastAPI run config for `main.py` and a Python Tests config for `test_main.py`.

## AWS EC2 instance
This app is currently running as a Docker container on a Micro EC2 instance on AWS, behind a `nginx` server. Visit https://3.137.151.190/docs for the Book Search API docs (generated by Swagger).
